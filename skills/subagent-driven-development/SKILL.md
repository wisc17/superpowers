# Subagent-Driven Development

Execute plan by dispatching fresh subagent per task, with code review after each.

**Core principle:** Fresh subagent per task + review between tasks = high quality, fast iteration

## Overview

**vs. Executing Plans (parallel session):**
- Same session (no context switch)
- Fresh subagent per task (no context pollution)
- Code review after each task (catch issues early)
- Faster iteration (no human-in-loop between tasks)

**When to use:**
- Staying in this session
- Tasks are mostly independent
- Want continuous progress with quality gates

**When NOT to use:**
- Need to review plan first (use executing-plans)
- Tasks are tightly coupled (manual execution better)
- Plan needs revision (brainstorm first)

## The Process

### 1. Load Plan

1. Read plan file
2. Extract all tasks
3. Create TodoWrite with all tasks

### 2. Execute Task with Subagent

For each task:

**1. Prepare task context:**
- Read the full text of Task N from plan file
- Identify scene-setting context:
  - Where this task fits in overall plan
  - Dependencies on previous tasks
  - Architectural context subagent needs
  - Relevant patterns or existing code to follow

**2. Dispatch fresh subagent with full task text:**
```
Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Implement Task N: [task name]"
  prompt: |
    You are implementing Task N: [task name]

    ## Task Description

    [FULL TEXT of task from plan - paste it here, don't make subagent read file]

    ## Context

    [Scene-setting: where this fits, dependencies, architectural context]

    ## Before You Begin

    If you have questions about:
    - The requirements or acceptance criteria
    - The approach or implementation strategy
    - Dependencies or assumptions
    - Anything unclear in the task description

    **Ask them now.** Raise any concerns before starting work.

    ## Your Job

    Once you're clear on requirements:
    1. Implement exactly what the task specifies
    2. Write tests (following TDD if task says to)
    3. Verify implementation works
    4. Commit your work
    5. Report back

    Work from: [directory]

    ## Report Format

    When done, report:
    - What you implemented
    - What you tested and test results
    - Files changed
    - Any issues or concerns
```

**3. Handle subagent response:**

If subagent asks questions:
- Answer clearly
- Provide additional context if needed
- Either continue conversation or re-dispatch with answers

If subagent proceeds with implementation:
- Review their report
- Proceed to code review (Step 3)

### 3. Review Subagent's Work

**Dispatch code-reviewer subagent:**
```
Task tool (superpowers:code-reviewer):
  Use template at requesting-code-review/code-reviewer.md

  WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED: [from subagent's report]
  PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS: Task N from [plan-file]
  BASE_SHA: [commit before task]
  HEAD_SHA: [current commit]
  DESCRIPTION: [task summary]
```

**Code reviewer returns:** Strengths, Issues (Critical/Important/Minor), Assessment

### 4. Apply Review Feedback

**If issues found:**
- Fix Critical issues immediately
- Fix Important issues before next task
- Note Minor issues

**Dispatch follow-up subagent if needed:**
```
"Fix issues from code review: [list issues]"
```

### 5. Mark Complete, Next Task

- Mark task as completed in TodoWrite
- Move to next task
- Repeat steps 2-5

### 6. Final Review

After all tasks complete, dispatch final code-reviewer:
- Reviews entire implementation
- Checks all plan requirements met
- Validates overall architecture

### 7. Complete Development

After final review passes:
- Announce: "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch
- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice

## Example Workflow

```
You: I'm using Subagent-Driven Development to execute this plan.

[Read plan file: docs/plans/feature-plan.md]
[Extract 5 tasks, create TodoWrite]

Task 1: Hook installation script

[Read Task 1 full text from plan]
[Prepare context: "First task, no dependencies, creates new install-hook command"]
[Dispatch implementation subagent with full task text + context]

Subagent: "Before I begin - should the hook be installed at user or system level?"

You: "User level (~/.config/superpowers/hooks/)"

Subagent: "Got it. Implementing now..."
[Later] Subagent: Implemented install-hook with tests, 5/5 passing

[Get git SHAs, dispatch code-reviewer]
Reviewer: Strengths: Good test coverage. Issues: None. Ready.

[Mark Task 1 complete]

Task 2: Recovery modes

[Read Task 2 full text]
[Prepare context: "Depends on Task 1 hook structure, adds verify/repair modes"]
[Dispatch implementation subagent with full task text + context]

Subagent: [No questions, proceeds]
Subagent: Added verify/repair, 8/8 tests passing

[Dispatch code-reviewer]
Reviewer: Strengths: Solid. Issues (Important): Missing progress reporting

[Dispatch fix subagent]
Fix subagent: Added progress every 100 conversations

[Verify fix, mark Task 2 complete]

...

[After all tasks]
[Dispatch final code-reviewer]
Final reviewer: All requirements met, ready to merge

Done!
```

## Advantages

**vs. Manual execution:**
- Subagents follow TDD naturally
- Fresh context per task (no confusion)
- Parallel-safe (subagents don't interfere)
- Subagent can ask questions before starting (reduces ambiguity)

**vs. Executing Plans:**
- Same session (no handoff)
- Continuous progress (no waiting)
- Review checkpoints automatic

**Efficiency gains:**
- No file reading overhead (controller provides full text)
- Controller curates exactly what context is needed
- Subagent gets complete information upfront
- Questions surfaced before work begins (not after)

**Cost:**
- More subagent invocations
- Controller does more prep work (reading/extracting tasks)
- But catches issues early (cheaper than debugging later)

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Skip code review between tasks
- Proceed with unfixed Critical issues
- Dispatch multiple implementation subagents in parallel (conflicts)
- Make subagent read plan file (provide full text instead)
- Skip scene-setting context (subagent needs to understand where task fits)
- Ignore subagent questions (answer before letting them proceed)

**If subagent asks questions:**
- Answer clearly and completely
- Provide additional context if needed
- Don't rush them into implementation

**If subagent fails task:**
- Dispatch fix subagent with specific instructions
- Don't try to fix manually (context pollution)

## Integration

**Required workflow skills:**
- **writing-plans** - REQUIRED: Creates the plan that this skill executes
- **requesting-code-review** - REQUIRED: Review after each task (see Step 3)
- **finishing-a-development-branch** - REQUIRED: Complete development after all tasks (see Step 7)

**Subagents must use:**
- **test-driven-development** - Subagents follow TDD for each task

**Alternative workflow:**
- **executing-plans** - Use for parallel session instead of same-session execution
