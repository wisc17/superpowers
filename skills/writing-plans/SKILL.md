# Writing Plans

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS — Read Before Anything Else

**You MUST NOT call `EnterPlanMode` or `ExitPlanMode` at any point during this skill.** This skill operates in normal mode and manages its own completion flow via `AskUserQuestion`. Calling `EnterPlanMode` traps the session in plan mode where Write/Edit are restricted. Calling `ExitPlanMode` breaks the workflow and skips the user's execution choice. If you feel the urge to call either, STOP — follow this skill's instructions instead.

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

Assume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan."

**Context:** If working in an isolated worktree, it should have been created via the `superpowers-extended-cc:using-git-worktrees` skill at execution time.

**Save plans to:** `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`
- (User preferences for plan location override this default)

## Scope Check

If the spec covers multiple independent subsystems, it should have been broken into sub-project specs during brainstorming. If it wasn't, suggest breaking this into separate plans — one per subsystem. Each plan should produce working, testable software on its own.

## File Structure

Before defining tasks, map out which files will be created or modified and what each one is responsible for. This is where decomposition decisions get locked in.

- Design units with clear boundaries and well-defined interfaces. Each file should have one clear responsibility.
- You reason best about code you can hold in context at once, and your edits are more reliable when files are focused. Prefer smaller, focused files over large ones that do too much.
- Files that change together should live together. Split by responsibility, not by technical layer.
- In existing codebases, follow established patterns. If the codebase uses large files, don't unilaterally restructure - but if a file you're modifying has grown unwieldy, including a split in the plan is reasonable.

This structure informs the task decomposition. Each task should produce self-contained changes that make sense independently.

## REQUIRED FIRST STEP: Initialize Task Tracking

**BEFORE exploring code or writing the plan, you MUST:**

1. Call `TaskList` to check for existing tasks from brainstorming
2. If tasks exist: you will enhance them with implementation details as you write the plan
3. If no tasks: you will create them with `TaskCreate` as you write each plan task

**Do not proceed to exploration until TaskList has been called.**

```
TaskList
```

## Task Granularity

**Each task is a coherent unit of work that produces a testable, committable outcome.**

See `skills/shared/task-format-reference.md` for the full granularity guide.

Key principle: TDD cycles happen WITHIN tasks, not as separate tasks. A task is "Implement X with tests" — the red-green-refactor steps are execution detail inside the task, not task boundaries.

**Scope test:**
1. Can it be verified independently? (if no → too small)
2. Does it touch more than one concern? (if yes → too big)
3. Would it get its own commit? (if no → merge with adjacent task)

## Plan Document Header

**Every plan MUST start with this header:**

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers-extended-cc:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers-extended-cc:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

**User decisions (already made):** [One line per decision the user made during brainstorming/planning, quotable. "none" if none.]

---
```

### Deferred decisions

If the plan schedules questions for the user (a DECIDE list, an AskUserQuestion step), each question MUST:
- Cite why it is still open despite the header decisions. If a recorded decision answers it, answer from the record — do not re-ask.
- Carry the facts needed to answer it in the option descriptions: name the artifact AND its role/state (e.g. "stale GitHub mirror, last push 2026-03-25 — separate from your local-tools dev home"), and state what does NOT change under each option.
- Recommend nothing that contradicts a recorded decision. That is a plan failure (same severity as No Placeholders).

## Task Structure

````markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Goal:** [One sentence — what this task produces]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] [Concrete, testable criterion]
- [ ] [Another criterion]

**Verify:** `exact test command` → expected output

**Steps:**

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    result = function(input)
    assert result == expected
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```python
def function(input):
    return expected
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: PASS

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```
````

## No Placeholders

Every step must contain the actual content an engineer needs. These are **plan failures** — never write them:
- "TBD", "TODO", "implement later", "fill in details"
- "Add appropriate error handling" / "add validation" / "handle edge cases"
- "Write tests for the above" (without actual test code)
- "Similar to Task N" (repeat the code — the engineer may be reading tasks out of order)
- Steps that describe what to do without showing how (code blocks required for code steps)
- References to types, functions, or methods not defined in any task

## Remember
- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in every step — if a step changes code, show the code
- Exact commands with expected output
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits

## Self-Review

After writing the complete plan, look at the spec with fresh eyes and check the plan against it. This is a checklist you run yourself — not a subagent dispatch.

**1. Spec coverage:** Skim each section/requirement in the spec. Can you point to a task that implements it? List any gaps.

**2. Placeholder scan:** Search your plan for red flags — any of the patterns from the "No Placeholders" section above. Fix them.

**3. Type consistency:** Do the types, method signatures, and property names you used in later tasks match what you defined in earlier tasks? A function called `clearLayers()` in Task 3 but `clearFullLayers()` in Task 7 is a bug.

If you find issues, fix them inline. No need to re-review — just fix and move on. If you find a spec requirement with no task, add the task.

## Execution Handoff

<HARD-GATE>
STOP. You are about to complete the plan. DO NOT call EnterPlanMode or ExitPlanMode. You MUST call AskUserQuestion below. Both are FORBIDDEN — EnterPlanMode traps the session, ExitPlanMode skips the user's execution choice.
</HARD-GATE>

Your ONLY permitted next action is calling `AskUserQuestion` with this EXACT structure:

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Plan complete and saved to docs/superpowers/plans/<filename>.md. How would you like to execute it?"
  header: "Execution"
  options:
    - label: "Subagent-Driven (this session)"
      description: "I dispatch fresh subagent per task, review between tasks, fast iteration"
    - label: "Parallel Session (separate)"
      description: "Open new session in worktree with executing-plans, batch execution with checkpoints"
```

**If you are about to call ExitPlanMode, STOP — call AskUserQuestion instead.**

<HARD-GATE>
STOP. The user has chosen an execution method. You MUST invoke the corresponding skill using the Skill tool NOW. Do NOT implement tasks yourself — do NOT read files, make edits, or update task statuses. Your ONLY permitted action is invoking the skill below.

**If Subagent-Driven chosen:**
Invoke the Skill tool: `superpowers-extended-cc:subagent-driven-development`
- The skill handles everything: subagent dispatch, review, task tracking
- You stay in this session as the coordinator
- Do NOT start working on tasks directly

**If Parallel Session chosen:**
Guide the user to open a new session in the worktree, then invoke: `superpowers-extended-cc:executing-plans`
</HARD-GATE>

## Native Task Integration Reference

Use Claude Code's native task tools (v2.1.16+) to create structured tasks alongside the plan document.

### Creating Native Tasks

For each task in the plan, create a corresponding native task. Embed metadata as a `json:metadata` code fence at the end of the description — this is the only way to ensure metadata survives TaskGet (the `metadata` parameter on TaskCreate is accepted but not returned by TaskGet).

#### User-Thrown Gates — Mechanical Detection + Tagging

You MUST run this check for EVERY task you create. It takes seconds and is the cheapest part of the whole user-gate flow.

**Step 1 — Scan for gate-language.** For each of these, search the user's brief AND the task's Goal/Acceptance Criteria, case-insensitive, whole-word where reasonable:

| Bucket | Keywords / patterns |
|--------|---------------------|
| Verbs | `verify`, `prove`, `validate`, `confirm`, `ensure`, `check`, `gate` |
| Nouns | `verification gate`, `acceptance test`, `smoke test`, `end-to-end`, `E2E` |
| Scope | `first on one`, `then all`, `one before the rest`, `before proceeding`, `don't continue until` |
| Proof | `prove it works`, `make sure`, `demonstrate`, `show that` |

**Trigger rule** — a task is a user-thrown gate ONLY if:
- a **Nouns** match is found (these phrases are unambiguous gate nouns), OR
- a **Scope** match is found (commitment to ordering is a gate by itself), OR
- a **Verbs** match co-occurs with EITHER a Scope or a Proof match.

A **Verbs** match ALONE is not enough. Normal work briefs routinely say "validate the output" or "check that imports work" without asking for a gate. If the user wanted a gate, they committed to ordering ("do X before Y", "first on one"), named the artifact ("smoke test", "acceptance test"), or demanded proof ("prove it works", "show that"). One of those MUST be present in addition to the verb.

If no bucket matches, or only Verbs match → regular task, no tagging needed.

**Step 2 — Tag the task.** In the task's `json:metadata` fence:

1. Set `"userGate": true`.
2. Append `"user-gate"` to the `tags` array (create the array if absent).
3. If the user's brief specified the HOW concretely (named a command, entity, subagent, or observable), put it straight into `verifyCommand` and `acceptanceCriteria` — done.
4. If HOW is vague, set `"requiresUserSpecification": true` **only** when the verification sentence names no testable noun (function, command, entity, endpoint, file, log pattern) AND no concrete value (expected result, threshold, example input/output). One foothold — e.g. "verify each op with real inputs" — is enough for the agent to self-solve. The flag is for pure adjectives ("solid", "works", "good", "proper") where any guess is a shot in the dark.

**Step 3 — Add the prose banner** (mandatory whenever `userGate: true`). Near the top of the task description, right under **Goal:**, include verbatim:

> **USER-ORDERED GATE — NON-SKIPPABLE.** This task was requested by the user in the current conversation. It MUST NOT be closed by walking around it, by declaring it "verified inline", or by substituting a cheaper check. Close only after every item in `acceptanceCriteria` has been re-validated independently, with output captured.

**Tasks with declared evidence axes — set `requireEvidenceTokens`.** When a task's close is meaningful only if the coordinator has actually observed two (or more) labeled states, declare the axes in metadata. The `post-task-complete-revalidate` hook refuses the close unless at least one token from each axis appears in the close window. Examples:

- **Empirical refactor / A/B:** either explicit (`"requireEvidenceTokens": [["baseline","old","iter-0"], ["refactored","new","iter-1"]]`) or shortcut (`"requireABCompare": true`).
- **v2→v3 migration verification:** `"requireEvidenceTokens": [["v2","legacy"], ["v3","migrated"]]`.
- **Perf before/after:** `[["slow","unoptimized","p50=X"], ["fast","optimized","p50=Y"]]` — include the literal metric tags you expect the coordinator to post.
- **Multi-arm experiment:** `[["control"], ["variant-a"], ["variant-b"]]` — any number of axes.
- **Security pre/post fix:** `[["vulnerable","CVE-","before-patch"], ["patched","after-patch","hardened"]]`.

Without the axes, "looks good, keep going" closes are legal; with axes, the coordinator must produce evidence from each declared side. Pair with a concrete `verifyCommand` that actually runs both sides when possible (e.g. `diff <(old-cmd) <(new-cmd)`).

**Banner ↔ metadata invariant — both paths must agree.** The banner goes inside the SAME TaskCreate `description` string as the `json:metadata` fence, not only in the plan `.md`. If you are writing both a plan document AND creating native tasks, the banner must appear in BOTH places for the same task, OR in NEITHER. Self-check before moving on: for each task, the plan doc section and the TaskCreate description must both either have `userGate: true` + banner + fence, or have none of them.

**Step 4 — Check acceptance criteria operational specificity.** Each criterion MUST name an observable. Vague ("integration works", "it passes") is not acceptable — rewrite to "sensor X reports idle", "HTTP 200 from `/health`", "setup.done file present", etc. If you cannot make a criterion operational, set `requiresUserSpecification: true` and let `/specify-gate` collect the real answer.

**Step 5 — Per-task isolation self-check.** For every task where you set `userGate: true` and DIDN'T set `requiresUserSpecification: true`, re-read ONLY that task's **Goal** sentence in isolation — pretend no other task exists. Does that sentence alone name an observable, a capture method, AND a pass/fail value? If no to any of the three, set `requiresUserSpecification: true` even if you already filled in a `verifyCommand` from context. Borrowing concreteness from sibling tasks is the failure mode this catches. Example: a plan with per-op tasks saying "verify add(3,2)==5" (concrete) and a final task saying "make sure the whole thing works" (vague) — the per-op tasks anchor; the final task fails this check and MUST carry `requiresUserSpecification: true`.

**Tag liberally when a real gate signal is present.** The three shades of gate (strict user gate / strict agent gate / gray in-between) all get the same tag — if the trigger rule above matches, err on the side of tagging. But do not read a gate into normal verbs: "validate", "check", "verify" on their own describe routine work, not user-thrown gates. Over-tagging on real signals is harmless (extra metadata). Over-tagging on bare verbs produces the banner flood that makes every task look high-ceremony and drowns the real gates.

**Do NOT ask the user questions during write-plan.** The opinionated default is "tag it and move on". Users who wanted questions said "brainstorm". If the user's brief is vague about a gate's HOW, the flag `requiresUserSpecification: true` routes the question to execute time where `/specify-gate` handles it in 3-5 short multiple-choice prompts.

See `skills/shared/task-format-reference.md` → "User-Thrown Gates" for the full metadata schema with all six gate-related keys (`userGate`, `tags`, `requiresUserSpecification`, `gateScope`, `failurePolicy`, `subagentBrief`), and `docs/user-gate-flow.md` for the end-to-end flow.

#### TaskCreate description — full structured body, not a summary

**Hard rule.** Every TaskCreate `description` MUST contain, verbatim, the same **Goal / Files / Acceptance Criteria / Verify** sections you wrote into the plan `.md` for that task. Do NOT condense into a one-sentence summary. Do NOT move the AC to "see the plan doc". Do NOT omit `**Verify:**`. The description MUST end with the `json:metadata` code fence.

**Why it matters.** Both execution paths (`executing-plans` and `subagent-driven-development`) read the task description via TaskGet and pass it to the implementing subagent. A one-sentence description makes the subagent improvise AC. The plan `.md` is not a fallback — TaskGet does not read it.

**Self-check before finishing the skill.** After TaskCreate for every task, open the task description (via TaskGet or by reading `<plan>.tasks.json`) and confirm all four section headers (`**Goal:**`, `**Files:**`, `**Acceptance Criteria:**`, `**Verify:**`) AND the `json:metadata` fence are present. If any section is missing → TaskUpdate the description to the full block.

```yaml
TaskCreate:
  subject: "Task N: [Component Name]"
  description: |
    **Goal:** [From task's Goal line]

    **Files:**
    [From task's Files section]

    **Acceptance Criteria:**
    [From task's Acceptance Criteria]

    **Verify:** [From task's Verify line]

    **Steps:**
    [Key actions from task's Steps — abbreviated]

    ```json:metadata
    {"files": ["path/to/file1.py"], "verifyCommand": "pytest tests/path/ -v", "acceptanceCriteria": ["criterion 1", "criterion 2"], "modelTier": "mechanical"}
    ```
  activeForm: "Implementing [Component Name]"
```

### Why Embedded Metadata

The `metadata` parameter on TaskCreate is accepted but **not returned by TaskGet**. Embedding it as a `json:metadata` code fence in the description ensures:
- TaskGet returns the full metadata (it's part of the description)
- Cross-session resume can parse it from .tasks.json
- Subagent dispatch can extract it for implementer prompts

See `skills/shared/task-format-reference.md` for the full metadata schema.

### Setting Dependencies

After all tasks created, set blockedBy relationships:

```
TaskUpdate:
  taskId: [task-id]
  addBlockedBy: [prerequisite-task-ids]
```

### During Execution

Update task status as work progresses:

```
TaskUpdate:
  taskId: [task-id]
  status: in_progress  # when starting

TaskUpdate:
  taskId: [task-id]
  status: completed    # when done
```

---

## Task Persistence

At plan completion, write the task persistence file **in the same directory as the plan document**.

If the plan is saved to `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-01-15-feature.md`, the tasks file MUST be saved to `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-01-15-feature.md.tasks.json`.

```json
{
  "planPath": "docs/superpowers/plans/2026-01-15-feature.md",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "subject": "Task 0: ...",
      "status": "pending",
      "description": "**Goal:** ...\n\n**Files:**\n...\n\n```json:metadata\n{\"files\": [\"path/to/file.py\"], \"verifyCommand\": \"pytest tests/ -v\", \"acceptanceCriteria\": [\"criterion 1\"], \"modelTier\": \"mechanical\"}\n```"
    },
    {
      "id": 1,
      "subject": "Task 1: ...",
      "status": "pending",
      "blockedBy": [0],
      "description": "**Goal:** ...\n\n```json:metadata\n{\"files\": [], \"verifyCommand\": \"\", \"acceptanceCriteria\": [], \"modelTier\": \"standard\"}\n```"
    }
  ],
  "lastUpdated": "<timestamp>"
}
```

Both the plan `.md` and `.tasks.json` must be co-located in `docs/superpowers/plans/`.

### Resuming Work

Any new session can resume by running:
```
/superpowers-extended-cc:executing-plans <plan-path>
```

The skill reads the `.tasks.json` file and continues from where it left off.
