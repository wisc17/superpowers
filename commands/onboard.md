# Superpowers Onboarding

Walk the user through superpowers' optional features one at a time. For each feature: ask, then immediately write the chosen configuration — no deferred "now apply this yourself" summary.

## Ground rules

- **Assume a clean slate.** Do NOT scan for existing configuration before asking — go straight to the questions. The user runs this command to set settings, not to audit them.
- **Discrepancy handling (the only state handling you do):** if a file you are about to write already exists with different content, stop and show the difference, then let the user decide free-form (keep / overwrite / adjust). "Different" means: for `docs/superpowers/model-routing.json` and `docs/superpowers/workflow.json`, any existing content that differs from what you are about to write; for `.claude/settings.json`, an existing hook entry whose `command` references the same script filename you are adding.
- Each feature is optional. "No" means write nothing and move to the next feature.
- **NEVER commit anything.** Files are written to the working tree only; committing is the user's call.
- After the last feature, summarize: what was written and where, what was skipped, and how to undo each (see Closing).

## Scope — ask ONCE, before Feature 1

One scope answer governs every write in this run: config files AND settings writes (env vars, hook registrations).

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Where should superpowers configuration live?"
  header: "Scope"
  multiSelect: false
  options:
    - label: "This project (recommended)"
      description: "Config files in docs/superpowers/ of this repo; hook registrations in this project's .claude/settings.json. Applies only here. Create missing directories; that is intentional."
    - label: "User-level (all projects)"
      description: "Config files in ~/.claude/superpowers/; hook registrations in ~/.claude/settings.json. Applies to every project without its own project-level config; a project file always overrides entirely."
```

The scope fixes these targets for the rest of the run:

| Scope | Config files (Features 2 & 4) | Settings writes (Features 1 & 3) |
|-------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| This project | `docs/superpowers/<file>.json` | `<cwd>/.claude/settings.json` |
| User-level | `~/.claude/superpowers/<file>.json` | `~/.claude/settings.json` |

State the two chosen targets back to the user in one line, then proceed to Feature 1. Never re-ask scope per feature.

## Feature 1: Native Task Tools

One-line intro: Claude Code 2.1.233 and newer ship without the task tools on current models, and superpowers is built on them — plans become native tasks, `.tasks.json` resumes them across sessions, and two gates hook `TaskCreate`.

1. **Detect first** (second exception to the clean-slate rule). If `TaskCreate` is in your own tool list, the tools are already on: say so, write nothing, go to Feature 2. Otherwise ask.

   ```yaml
   AskUserQuestion:
     question: "Native task tools are off in this session. Turn them on?"
     header: "Task tools"
     multiSelect: false
     options:
       - label: "Yes (recommended)"
         description: "Writes CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS=1 into the scope's settings.json. Restores the task list, .tasks.json cross-session resume, blockedBy ordering, and the TaskCreate gates."
       - label: "No"
         description: "Plans still execute, but with no task list, no cross-session resume, no blockedBy enforcement, and no TaskCreate gates. Nothing is written."
   ```

2. **Yes** → read-merge-write `{"env": {"CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS": "1"}}` into the scope's settings target (resolve a symlink and edit the real target; never drop existing keys). Re-read to confirm and report the absolute path. Claude Code applies the change without a restart; if `TaskCreate` still does not appear later in this run, tell the user to start a new session. Off-switch: remove the `env` key.

3. **No** → write nothing. Say once that the task-based parts of the remaining features degrade accordingly.

## Feature 2: Subagent Model Routing

One-line intro for the user before asking: plan execution dispatches an implementer plus reviewers per task, and by default they all inherit the session model — on frontier-priced sessions (Opus, Fable) that multiplies the most expensive model across routine tasks. Full explanation: README.md → "Subagent Model Routing — Optional Flow".

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Enable model routing for plan-execution subagents?"
  header: "Routing"
  multiSelect: false
  options:
    - label: "Guided tiers (recommended)"
      description: "mechanical→haiku, standard→sonnet, frontier→session model. Cheap models for routine implementation, mid-tier for integration and reviews, full power only where judgment lives."
    - label: "One fixed model"
      description: "Every subagent uses one model you pick next — flat cost cap, no per-task gradation."
    - label: "No"
      description: "Keep the default: every subagent inherits the session model. Nothing is written."
```

- **Guided tiers** → write `model-routing.json` to the scope's config target with this content:

  ```json
  {"mechanical": "haiku", "standard": "sonnet", "frontier": "inherit"}
  ```

- **One fixed model** → ask the model follow-up below first (do NOT write before both answers), then write the same structure with all three tiers set to the chosen value.

  ```yaml
  AskUserQuestion:
    question: "Which model should every subagent use?"
    header: "Model"
    multiSelect: false
    options:
      - label: "haiku"
        description: "Cheapest and fastest. Fine when plans are well-specified."
      - label: "sonnet"
        description: "Mid-tier reasoning at mid-tier price. The balanced cap."
      - label: "opus"
        description: "Frontier reasoning. Caps cost only on Fable-class sessions."
      - label: "fable"
        description: "Highest capability and price. Only useful as a cap if your session model is above it."
  ```

- **No** (to the top-level routing question) → write nothing.

- **Thinking-effort follow-up** (ask whenever a routing file is about to be written — execution guidance exists either way; this question is the user's control point over it):

  ```yaml
  AskUserQuestion:
    question: "Routed dispatches also get a recommended thinking effort per tier. Who controls it?"
    header: "Effort"
    multiSelect: false
    options:
      - label: "Automatic (Recommended)"
        description: "Write no effort keys. The session notice carries the recommended map (mechanical=low, standard=medium, frontier=inherit) as an implicit default and the dispatching model applies it autonomously."
      - label: "Pin the recommended map"
        description: "Write the map into the file explicitly. Same values, but labeled user-set in the notice, and yours to edit later."
      - label: "Set my own per-tier values"
        description: "Choose an effort (low/medium/high/inherit) per tier; your values are written and labeled user-set."
      - label: "Pin and enforce the map"
        description: "Write the recommended map AND turn on the dispatch gate for effort: a subagent dispatch that does not pin the tier's effort is blocked, same as a wrong model is. Requires dispatching through an effort-pinned agent type."
  ```

  - **Automatic** → write the tier mapping only; no effort keys.
  - **Pin the recommended map** → add `"effort": {"mechanical": "low", "standard": "medium", "frontier": "inherit"}` to the same write.
  - **Set my own** → ask one compact follow-up (`AskUserQuestion`, one question per tier or a single multi-part question) for the three tiers, then write the chosen values as the `"effort"` map. Warn inline if a mid-tier model is set above medium (costs frontier-class money for lower fidelity).
  - **Pin and enforce** → write the same `"effort"` map AND `"enforceEffort": true`. Tell the user plainly that this changes **two** things, not one:
    - **Effort** becomes enforced: the dispatch gate resolves the effort pinned by the dispatch's `subagent_type` (agent-definition frontmatter `effort:`) and blocks a mismatch.
    - **Model** becomes enforced for effort-pinned agent types too. An agent definition that pins `effort:` but no `model:` previously got an unconditional model exemption when the call passed a model parameter; with enforcement on, that parameter is checked against the task's tier like any other. This matters for any agent definition carrying a bare `effort:` key, including ones the user wrote for unrelated reasons. With enforcement off, the old exemption is untouched.

    Both dials are then checked independently. Off-switch: remove the `enforceEffort` key — that restores the previous behavior for both.

    **Also write the effort-pinned agent definitions**, because enforcement is unusable without at least one. Create these three files in the scope's agents directory — `<cwd>/.claude/agents/` for this-project scope, `~/.claude/agents/` for user-level — substituting low/medium/high in each:

    ```markdown
    ---
    name: effort-low
    description: Implementer pinned at low thinking effort. Model comes from the dispatch.
    effort: low
    tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep
    ---

    You execute one plan task exactly as specified. Follow the task's steps in
    order, ask before deviating, verify your work with the task's verify command,
    then report what you changed and whether every acceptance criterion holds.

    This definition pins thinking effort only. The model comes from the dispatch.
    ```

    Same file for `effort-medium` and `effort-high`, changing only `name:`, the effort word in `description:`, and `effort:`. Deliberately no `model:` key — the model travels on the Agent call and is enforced separately, so the two dials stay independent.

    Apply the standard discrepancy rule: if a file already exists with different content, stop and show the difference rather than overwriting. Confirm the absolute paths written back to the user.

After writing the file, tell the user: the plugin's routing gates activate immediately (they check for this file on every relevant tool call), and from the next session on a routing notice is injected at session start. No restart, no settings edits, no hook registration needed. Off-switch: delete the file. Also note: the notice includes a recommended per-tier thinking-effort map (implicit default; an `"effort"` key in the file overrides it). By default effort is advisory — the session-start notice is the whole delivery mechanism. If the user chose "Pin and enforce", it is not: the `Agent` tool has no effort parameter, but it does carry `subagent_type`, and the dispatch gate resolves that agent definition's frontmatter `effort:` and blocks a dispatch that does not match the tier's effort.

## Feature 3: User-Thrown Gate Enforcement Hooks

One-line intro: when the user asks for a verification gate ("make sure X works before proceeding"), opt-in hooks force re-validation with captured evidence when such a task is closed — without them, gate tags are inert metadata. Full explanation: README.md → "User-Thrown Gate Enforcement — Optional Flow".

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Enable enforcement hooks for user-thrown verification gates?"
  header: "Gates"
  multiSelect: false
  options:
    - label: "Yes, both hooks (recommended)"
      description: "Per-task close enforcement + end-of-plan stop enforcement. They compose."
    - label: "Per-task hook only"
      description: "Only re-validate when an individual gate task is closed."
    - label: "No"
      description: "Gate tagging stays inert metadata. Nothing is written."
```

On yes, write the hook registration(s) into the scope's settings target — `<cwd>/.claude/settings.json` for this-project scope, `~/.claude/settings.json` for user-level:

1. Take the JSON block(s) from README.md → "Recommended Configuration": "Force Re-Validation on User-Thrown Gate Close" (per-task) and "Re-Validate Gates on 'Plan Complete' Claims" (end-of-plan).
2. **Verify the script path before writing.** The README blocks reference scripts under `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/superpowers-extended-cc-marketplace/hooks/examples/`. Check that path exists (`ls` the directory); if the plugin lives elsewhere on this machine, substitute the real path in the `command` values.
3. **Merge, never overwrite.** Read the scope's settings file first (resolve a symlink and edit the real target). If it exists: parse it, append each new hook entry into the matching array (`hooks.PostToolUse` / `hooks.Stop`), creating only the missing keys, and write the full merged result back. If it does not exist: create it containing only the chosen hooks structure. Never drop existing entries.
4. **Duplicate check spans both scopes:** if the same hook script is already registered in EITHER the project file or the user file, do not add it again — report where it already lives and which scope it covers.
5. **Confirm the write.** Re-read the target file, verify the new entries parse and are present, and report the confirmed absolute path back to the user. Output of this feature MUST name the file that was actually written.
6. **"Yes" also disables Auto Plan Mode:** merge `{"permissions": {"deny": ["EnterPlanMode"]}}` into the scope's settings file (same read-merge-write as step 3).

## Feature 4: Commit Strategy

One-line intro: plan execution commits after every task by default — each plan task ends with its own Commit step and implementer subagents commit their own work; switching to a single commit at the end of the plan gives one reviewable commit per feature. Full explanation: README.md → "Commit Strategy".

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "How should plan execution commit its work?"
  header: "Commits"
  multiSelect: false
  options:
    - label: "Per-task commits (recommended)"
      description: "The default: every task ends with its own commit — fine-grained history, per-task rollback. Nothing is written."
    - label: "Single commit at plan end"
      description: "Tasks leave changes uncommitted; one final plan task commits the full implementation as a single commit."
```

- **Per-task commits** → write nothing (an absent file already means per-task).
- **Single commit at plan end** → write `workflow.json` to the scope's config target with this content:

  ```json
  {"commitStrategy": "at-end"}
  ```

After writing the file, tell the user: the plan-time side is enforced by a TaskCreate gate that blocks per-task commit steps in plan tasks (dispatch time stays advisory); delivery starts at the next session (the current session keeps per-task behavior). Off-switch: delete the file, or remove the `commitStrategy` key; runtime kill switch: `SUPERPOWERS_WORKFLOW_GUARD=0`.

Then ask one follow-up in the same feature:

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Should brainstorming offer its visual companion (browser mockups/diagrams) proactively?"
  header: "Visuals"
  multiSelect: false
  options:
    - label: "Just-in-time (recommended)"
      description: "The default: offered only when a question is clearer shown than told, architectural path only. Nothing is written."
    - label: "Always offer"
      description: "On every brainstorming path, the companion is offered as soon as the design involves a screen, layout, diagram, or comparison."
```

- **Just-in-time** → write nothing.
- **Always offer** → add `"visualCompanion": "always"` to the scope's `workflow.json` (create the file with just that key, or add the key to the existing object). Off-switch: remove the key or the file.

## Feature 5: Plugin Auto-Update

One-line intro: third-party marketplaces do NOT auto-update by default, so new `superpowers-extended-cc` releases won't reach this install on their own — you'd have to run `/plugin marketplace update` by hand each time. Enabling auto-update lets Claude Code refresh the marketplace and its plugins at startup.

**This feature is the one exception to the clean-slate rule** — it checks current state before asking, because proposing a change that is already in place is noise. Auto-update is marketplace-level (there is no per-plugin toggle) and lives wherever the marketplace is registered — almost always user-level `~/.claude/settings.json`. The onboard scope choice does NOT apply here; marketplaces are registered user-wide.

1. **Detect.** Read `~/.claude/settings.json` (resolve a symlink to the real target) and inspect `extraKnownMarketplaces["superpowers-extended-cc-marketplace"].autoUpdate`. If the marketplace entry is not there, check the project `<cwd>/.claude/settings.json`. Then:
   - `true` → already enabled: tell the user, write nothing, move on.
   - `false` or the key absent → not enabled; ask.
   - marketplace entry in neither file → it is not registered in settings (unusual for an installed plugin); say so and skip this feature. Do NOT invent a marketplace entry.

2. **Ask** (only when not already enabled):

   ```yaml
   AskUserQuestion:
     question: "Enable auto-update for the superpowers-extended-cc marketplace? New releases would then install at the next Claude Code startup."
     header: "Auto-update"
     multiSelect: false
     options:
       - label: "Yes, enable auto-update (recommended)"
         description: "Sets autoUpdate=true on the marketplace entry in settings.json. Claude Code refreshes the marketplace and updates its plugins at the next startup."
       - label: "No"
         description: "Leave it off — stay on the current version until you run /plugin marketplace update manually. Nothing is written."
   ```

3. **Yes** → set `extraKnownMarketplaces["superpowers-extended-cc-marketplace"].autoUpdate = true` in the file where that entry lives. Read-merge-write (resolve the symlink, edit the real target); never drop the entry's other keys (e.g. `source`) or any other marketplace. Re-read to confirm the value is `true`, report the absolute path written, and tell the user it takes effect at the next Claude Code startup (no in-session restart).

   **Yes also registers the drift check** — auto-updated releases can add new settings keys silently, and this hook is the one channel that surfaces them. Add to the `hooks.SessionStart` array of `~/.claude/settings.json` (read-merge-write, same file-handling rules; skip if an entry referencing `check-onboard-drift` already exists):

   ```json
   {"hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/check-onboard-drift\""}]}
   ```

   It compares the plugin's `hooks/onboard-features.json` against the config files this onboarding wrote and stays silent unless a later release adds a key to a file that exists here; then it emits one line suggesting a re-run of onboarding for just that option.

4. **No** → write nothing.

## Final step: remove the upstream double-install (optional)

Installing `superpowers-extended-cc` alongside the original `obra/superpowers` leaves both active at the same time. Every skill ships under both the `superpowers:` namespace and the `superpowers-extended-cc:` namespace — the slash-command palette shows doubled entries for `brainstorming`, `writing-plans`, `subagent-driven-development`, and every other shared skill, and the session-start skill loader may trigger either version ambiguously. This fork supersedes upstream, so the original is redundant once the fork is installed.

Assess for yourself whether both are actually present. This fork lives at `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/superpowers-extended-cc-marketplace/`; the upstream plugin would sit right next to it at `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/superpowers-marketplace/`, or — if it came from the official plugin directory instead — be registered as `superpowers@claude-plugins-official` in `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json`.

If upstream is not there: say nothing, skip this step entirely, and proceed directly to Closing.

If both are present: explain the conflict to the user in one short paragraph — both plugins are active, they ship identical skill names under two prefixes, and the fork supersedes upstream — then, and only then, ask:

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Remove the upstream obra/superpowers plugin to clear the duplicate entries?"
  header: "Double-install"
  multiSelect: false
  options:
    - label: "Yes, remove upstream"
      description: "Uninstall the upstream superpowers plugin and, if it was the only plugin from that marketplace, remove the marketplace too. Uses /plugin in-context."
    - label: "No, leave both installed"
      description: "Keep both active — you can clean this up later via /plugin."
```

- **Yes** → carry out the removal via the `/plugin` interface in-context: uninstall the upstream plugin (`superpowers@superpowers-marketplace` or `superpowers@claude-plugins-official`, whichever is registered), then, if its marketplace now has no other installed plugins, remove the marketplace as well. Confirm each step back to the user.
- **No** → acknowledge and move on.

## Closing

Report in one short block: the chosen scope, files written (confirmed absolute paths), features skipped, and how to undo each — remove the `env.CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS` key from the scope's settings file (task tools); delete the scope's `model-routing.json` (routing); remove the hook objects you added from the arrays in the scope's settings file, `<cwd>/.claude/settings.json` or `~/.claude/settings.json` (gate hooks); delete the scope's `workflow.json` or remove its `commitStrategy` key (commit strategy); set `extraKnownMarketplaces["superpowers-extended-cc-marketplace"].autoUpdate` back to `false` in settings.json (auto-update). Do not commit. Do not re-ask any question.
